| <h3>Langchain TS</h3> Javascript bindings for Langchain. It integrates with LanceDB's serverless vectordb allowing you to build powerful AI applications through composibility using only serverless functions. <h3>[Learn More]( https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/integrations/lancedb) | <img src="../assets/langchain.png" alt="image" width="150" height="auto">|
| <h3>Voxel51</h3>  It is an open source toolkit that enables you to build better computer vision workflows by improving the quality of your datasets and delivering insights about your models.<h3>[Learn More](./voxel51.md) | <img src="../assets/voxel.gif" alt="image" width="150" height="auto">|
| <h3>PromptTools</h3>  Offers a set of free, open-source tools for testing and experimenting with models, prompts, and configurations. The core idea is to enable developers to evaluate prompts using familiar interfaces like code and notebooks. You can use it to experiment with different configurations of LanceDB, and test how LanceDB integrates with the LLM of your choice.<h3>[Learn More](./prompttools.md) | <img src="../assets/prompttools.jpeg" alt="image" width="150" height="auto">||
| <h3>Mastra</h3> An open-source TypeScript agent framework for building AI applications with memory, workflows, and RAG capabilities. Integrate LanceDB as a vector store for Mastra's RAG systems to provide your agents with application-specific knowledge and contextual memory. <h3>[Learn More](./mastra.md)                                                                                                       |  <img src="../assets/mastra-logo.png" alt="image" width="400" height="auto"> |
