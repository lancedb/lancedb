    "Reproducibility is critical for AI. For code, it's easy to keep track of changes using Github or Gitlab.\n",
    "For data, it's not as easy. Most of the time, we're manually writing complicated data tracking code, wrestling with an external tool, and dealing with expensive duplicate snapshot copies with low granularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For vector databases, if we make a mistake, we have to blow away the index, correct the mistake, and then completely rebuild it. It's difficult to rollback mistakes and it destroys any historical paper trail to debug and diagnose errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "LanceDB is the first and only vector database that supports full reproducibility natively.\n",
    "Taking advantage of Lance columnar format, LanceDB supports:\n",
    "- automatic versioning\n",
    "- instance rollback\n",
    "- appends, updates, deletions\n",
    "- schema evolution\n",
