### Reranking in Search
Reranking is the process of reordering search results based on additional criteria or algorithms to improve relevance and user satisfaction. It plays a crucial role in refining initial search outputs, ensuring that the most pertinent results are prioritized. Various reranking techniques exist, including learning-to-rank models, heuristic-based approaches, and statistical measures like MRR.

In the context of hybrid search systems, reranking can be particularly beneficial as it allows for the integration of diverse ranking signals from both keyword-based and semantic search methods. By applying a reranking algorithm such as MRR, search systems can prioritize results that are not only relevant based on keyword matching but also contextually significant according to semantic understanding. This dual approach helps in achieving a balance between precision and recall, ultimately enhancing the user experience by delivering more accurate and meaningful search results.
