# Interface: IndexOptions

## Properties

### config?

```ts
optional config: Index;
```

Advanced index configuration

This option allows you to specify a specfic index to create and also
allows you to pass in configuration for training the index.

See the static methods on Index for details on the various index types.

If this is not supplied then column data type(s) and column statistics
will be used to determine the most useful kind of index to create.

***

### name?

```ts
optional name: string;
```

Optional custom name for the index.

If not provided, a default name will be generated based on the column name.

***

### replace?

```ts
optional replace: boolean;
```

Whether to replace the existing index

If this is false, and another index already exists on the same columns
and the same name, then an error will be returned.  This is true even if
that index is out of date.

The default is true

***

### train?

```ts
optional train: boolean;
```

Whether to train the index with existing data.

If true (default), the index will be trained with existing data in the table.
If false, the index will be created empty and populated as new data is added.

Note: This option is only supported for scalar indices. Vector indices always train.

***

### waitTimeoutSeconds?

```ts
optional waitTimeoutSeconds: number;
```

Timeout in seconds to wait for index creation to complete.

If not specified, the method will return immediately after starting the index creation.
