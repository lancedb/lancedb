# Interface: OpenTableOptions

## Properties

### indexCacheSize?

```ts
optional indexCacheSize: number;
```

Set the size of the index cache, specified as a number of entries

The exact meaning of an "entry" will depend on the type of index:
- IVF: there is one entry for each IVF partition
- BTREE: there is one entry for the entire index

This cache applies to the entire opened table, across all indices.
Setting this value higher will increase performance on larger datasets
at the expense of more RAM

***

### storageOptions?

```ts
optional storageOptions: Record<string, string>;
```

Configuration for object storage.

Options already set on the connection will be inherited by the table,
but can be overridden here.

The available options are described at https://lancedb.github.io/lancedb/guides/storage/
