3. **Optional**: AWS credentials for S3 examples
4. **Optional**: MinIO server for object storage examples

### Installation

1. Clone the LanceDB repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb.git
cd lancedb/golang
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
go mod tidy
```

3. Build the Go SDK (if needed):
```bash
make build
```

### Running Examples

Each example is self-contained and can be run independently:

```bash
# Basic CRUD operations
go run examples/basic_crud.go

# Vector search capabilities
go run examples/vector_search.go

# Hybrid search patterns
go run examples/hybrid_search.go

# Index management
go run examples/index_management.go

# Batch operations
go run examples/batch_operations.go

# Storage configuration
go run examples/storage_configuration.go

# Cloud deployment patterns
go run examples/cloud_deployment.go
```

## üîß Configuration

### Local Examples
Most examples work out-of-the-box with local storage and don't require additional configuration.

### AWS S3 Examples
For S3-related examples, you'll need AWS credentials configured:

1. **IAM Role (Recommended for EC2/ECS)**:
   - No additional configuration needed
   - Examples will use the instance's IAM role

2. **AWS Credentials File**:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   # Or set up ~/.aws/credentials
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
   export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   ```

### MinIO Examples
For MinIO examples, start a local MinIO server:

```bash
# Using Docker
docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 \
  -e "MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin" \
  -e "MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=minioadmin" \
  quay.io/minio/minio server /data --console-address ":9001"

# Create test bucket via MinIO console at http://localhost:9001
```

```

### Performance Testing
Use the `time` command to measure example execution:

```bash
time go run examples/batch_operations.go

### Memory Profiling
Enable Go's built-in profiling for memory analysis:

```bash
go run -pprof examples/batch_operations.go
```

## üìö Learning Path

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Errors:**
```
Error: failed to connect to database
Solution: Check file permissions and disk space for local storage
