//! Contains the [PermutationBuilder] to create a permutation "view" of an existing table.
//!
//! A permutation view can apply a filter, divide the data into splits, and shuffle the data.
//! The permutation table only stores the split ids and row ids.  It is not a materialized copy of
//! the underlying data and can be very lightweight.
//!
//! Building a permutation table should be fairly quick (it is an O(N) operation where N is
//! the number of rows in the base table) and memory efficient, even for billions or trillions
//! of rows.
