class PermutationBuilder:
    """
    A utility for creating a "permutation table" which is a table that defines an
    ordering on a base table.

    The permutation table does not store the actual data.  It only stores row
    ids and split ids to define the ordering.  The [Permutation] class can be used to
    read the data from the base table in the order defined by the permutation table.

    Permutations can split, shuffle, and filter the data in the base table.

    A filter limits the rows that are included in the permutation.
    Splits divide the data into subsets (for example, a test/train split, or K
    different splits for cross-validation).
    Shuffling randomizes the order of the rows in the permutation.

    Splits can optionally be named.  If names are provided it will enable them to
    be referenced by name in the future.  If names are not provided then they can only
    be referenced by their ordinal index.  There is no requirement to name every split.

    By default, the permutation will be stored in memory and will be lost when the
    program exits.  To persist the permutation (for very large datasets or to share
    the permutation across multiple workers) use the [persist](#persist) method to
    create a permanent table.
