   * For example, you may not care about "a" or "b" but instead simply want "a + b".  This is often

   *
   * To create dynamic columns you can pass in a Map<string, string>.  A column will be returned
   * for each entry in the map.  The key provides the name of the column.  The value is
   * an SQL string used to specify how the column is calculated.
   *
   * For example, an SQL query might state `SELECT a + b AS combined, c`.  The equivalent
   * input to this method would be:
   * @example
   * new Map([["combined", "a + b"], ["c", "c"]])
   *
   * Columns will always be returned in the order given, even if that order is different than
   * the order used when adding the data.
   *
   * Note that you can pass in a `Record<string, string>` (e.g. an object literal). This method
   * uses `Object.entries` which should preserve the insertion order of the object.  However,
   * object insertion order is easy to get wrong and `Map` is more foolproof.
